# Strawberry_stacker


The project's is an abstraction of a strawberry farm. It is the harvesting scenario in the strawberry farm where the harvesters are plucking the strawberry selectively which are ready for harvesting and packing them into small boxes. The harvesters usually separate the premium quality strawberries and pack them in a RED coloured box whereas the standard quality ones are packed in a BLUE coloured box. The boxes then have to be placed on respective trucks (red boxes on red truck and blue boxes on blue truck) to ship them further. This entire task from plucking to shipping has to be done as quickly as possible.
